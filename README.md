# cDanPhase2
Charlie Daniel Phase 2, rename files so xml and tif names match.
The starting point is CharlieDaniel files from Christina Harlow, cmh2166.

https://github.com/cmh2166/CharlieDaniel

The path to tiffs is at:

central: /d1/area3/special/CharlieDaniel-PhaseII/delivery/CharlieDaniel-PhaseII_cropped/

There are 6 directories:

1. Causes...................58 images

2. International............34 images

3. Knoxville................39 images

4. NationalPolitics........126 images

5. Sports...................26 images

6. Tennessee................28 images



File renaming strategy:

  a. The image files have legal filenames that continue the numbering used in CharlieDaniel Phase I. 
  
  b. The xml filenames are invalid because all contain the colon character (:) which is an illegal character.
  
  c. Renaming either a or b will require changes to identifier information in each xml file.
  
  d. Renaming the xml files will be required in any case due to the illegal character in each filename.
  
  e. Therefore, I vote for renaming the xml files to match the tif files and revising the xml files to reflect the change.
